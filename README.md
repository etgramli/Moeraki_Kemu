# Moeraki Kemu
---

This is a programm for the web technology course at the HTWG Konstanz. It is a fork of [another implementation of Moeraki Kemu](https://github.com/DanielHipp/moeraki-kemu) from an other course of programming. The issues found by FindBugs were fixed, and some parameters were made final.

This is the foundation for the HTML frontend made with the Play framework, that you can find [here](https://github.com/etgramli/Moeraki_Kemu_Activator). It must be exported to an executable jar file by Eclipse to be used as a library for the new project.
