# Moeraki Kemu
---

This is a programm for the web technology course at the HTWG Konstanz. It is a fork of [another implementation of Moeraki Kemu](https://github.com/DanielHipp/moeraki-kemu) from an other course of programming.

This is the foundation for the HTML frontend made with the Play framework, that you can find [here](https://github.com/etgramli/Moeraki_Kemu_Activator).
